# TrackIR5Mouse

This is a repository for hands-free cursor control solutions mostly utilizing Python.

FreePIE is an excellent tool. It is the first piece of software I used to get going quickly.
Unfortunately, it does not support the Win32 function SendInput. This is necessary for any pen enabled and some UWP application.

I prefered not to use relative mouse movements.
